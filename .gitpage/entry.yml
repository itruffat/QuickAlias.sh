  A lightweight Bash script for quickly creating and removing terminal aliases.
  It matches how I typically use aliases—just for a few hours or days—so instead of editing shell configs manually, this script handles everything for you. 
  No need to mess with your .bashrc or .zshrc; the aliases are temporary, easy to set up, and just as easy to tear down.
